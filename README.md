# E-commerce Project

## Project Overview

This is a simplified e-commerce platform built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. The platform allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, search for specific items, and simulate a checkout process. It also includes user authentication (sign-up and login functionality) and displays a dynamic user dashboard after login. This project demonstrates core front-end and back-end web development concepts.
